# blockchain_project1
Overview
This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain in Python. It includes transaction handling, proof of work mining, and validation of the blockchain. The system allows users to create transactions, mine new blocks, and validate the integrity of the blockchain.

Features
Implements a basic blockchain structure with blocks containing transactions.
Uses SHA-256 hashing for security.
Includes a proof-of-work mechanism to ensure security and decentralization.
Allows users to add transactions and mine them into blocks.
Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install Python from python.org.

Usage
The script initializes a blockchain with a genesis block.
Transactions are added using add_transaction(sender, recipient, amount).
Transactions are mined using mine_pending_transactions().
The blockchain validates itself to ensure integrity.

License
This project is open-source and available for modification and distribution.
